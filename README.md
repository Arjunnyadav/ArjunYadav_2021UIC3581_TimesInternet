## 🧠 Agent Flow & Architecture

### Conversation Flow Design

```mermaid

    A[Welcome] --> B[Income Assessment]
    B --> C[Dining Spending]
    C --> D[Fuel Spending]
    D --> E[Grocery Spending]
    E --> F[Travel Spending]
    F --> G[Online Spending]

    I --> J[Primary Use]
    J --> K[AI Processing]
    K --> L[Recommendations]
    L --> M[Comparison View]
    L --> N[Restart Flow]
```

### Agent Architecture

#### 1. ConversationFlow Class
```typescript
class ConversationFlow {
  private currentStep: number
  private profile: UserProfile
  private steps: ConversationStep[]
  
  // Core methods
  getCurrentStep(): ConversationStep
  processAnswer(answer: string): boolean
  getProfile(): UserProfile
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Step Management**: Tracks current conversation position
- **Answer Processing**: Parses and stores user responses
- **Profile Building**: Constructs comprehensive user profile
- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity throughout flow

#### 2. RecommendationEngine Class
```typescript
class RecommendationEngine {
  // Scoring algorithms
  calculateEligibilityScore(card: CreditCard, profile: UserProfile): number
  calculateSpendingScore(card: CreditCard, profile: UserProfile): number
  calculateBenefitsScore(card: CreditCard, profile: UserProfile): number
  
  // Recommendation generation
  getRecommendations(profile: UserProfile): Recommendation[]
}
```

### Prompt Design Strategy

#### 1. Question Formulation
- **Clear Intent**: Each question has a specific data collection purpose
- **User-Friendly Language**: Conversational tone with financial context
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed gradually to avoid overwhelm
- **Multiple Choice Options**: Structured responses for consistent data

#### 2. Context Preservation
- **Session State**: Maintains user responses throughout conversation
- **Adaptive Questioning**: Future questions informed by previous answers
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unexpected inputs

#### 3. Recommendation Explanation
- **Transparent Logic**: Clear reasoning for each recommendation
- **Quantified Benefits**: Specific reward calculations and projections
- **Comparative Analysis**: Relative strengths of each suggested card

## 🎯 Recommendation Engine

### Scoring Algorithm

The recommendation engine uses a multi-factor scoring system:

#### 1. Eligibility Score (55 points max)
- **Income Matching** (30 points): Compares annual income to card requirements
- **Credit Score Alignment** (25 points): Matches credit score to card criteria
- **Partial Credit**: Awards points for near-misses to increase inclusivity

#### 2. Spending Score (40 points max)
- **Category Weighting**: Analyzes spending distribution across categories
- **Reward Optimization**: Prioritizes cards with high rewards in user's top categories
- **Spending Volume**: Considers total monthly expenditure

#### 3. Benefits Score (30 points max)
- **Preference Matching**: Aligns card benefits with user preferences
- **Feature Bonuses**: Extra points for premium features (lounge access, fuel benefits)
- **Lifestyle Alignment**: Matches card perks to user's lifestyle

### Reward Calculation

```typescript
// Simplified reward calculation logic
const calculateEstimatedRewards = (card: CreditCard, profile: UserProfile) => {
  let totalRewards = 0;
  
  Object.entries(profile.spendingHabits).forEach(([category, monthlyAmount]) => {
    const annualAmount = monthlyAmount * 12;
    const rewardRate = card.categories[category];
    
    if (card.rewardType === 'cashback') {
      totalRewards += (annualAmount * rewardRate) / 100;
    } else {
      // Points/Miles: 1 point = ₹0.25 value
      totalRewards += (annualAmount * rewardRate * 0.25) / 100;
    }
  });
  
  return totalRewards + welcomeBonusValue;
};
```
